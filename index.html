			<p>I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. I work in the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~compphys/">Computational Physics Group</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/krishna/home">Professor Krishna Garikipati</a> and the <a href="https://bloodflow.engin.umich.edu/">Computational Vascular Biomechanics Laboratory</a> with <a href="https://bme.umich.edu/people/c-alberto-figueroa/">Professor Alberto Figueroa</a>. My research interests are computational sciences and biomechanics.</p>

			<p>I received my masters degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in August 2019. I worked in the <a href="https://uitbl.mechse.illinois.edu/">Tissue Biomechanics Laboratory</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/kershtbl">Professor Mariana Kersh</a>. My thesis was on the relationship between cortical bone strength and its micro-structure. More information on my work can be found <a href="https://lizliv.com/research/">here</a>.</p>

			<p>I also received my bachelors in Engineering Mechanics from UIUC in May 2017. My secondary field was Biomechatronics and I minored in Computational Science and Engineering. During my undergraduate studies I had the opportunity to study abroad in Hong Kong and Uruguay one summer, participated heavily in the <a href="http://sem.mechse.illinois.edu/">Society for Engineering Mechanics</a>, and walked on to the <a href="https://fightingillini.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=6841">UIUC Track and Field</a> team as a pole vaulter.</p>

			<p>Born in Los Angeles, raised in Dallas, educated in Urbana-Champaign, and now living in Ann Arbor, I love to travel and experience new things.  I enjoy camping, climbing, photography, television, video games, and playing guitar.</p>
